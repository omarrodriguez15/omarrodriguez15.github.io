    <p>One of my 2019 resolutions was to read at least one book per month. Now I can proudly say I read 22 books from start to finish in 2019. Before this I think I was reading maybe 1-3 books a year. (I’ll admit this post is a bit of a pat on the back for myself :))</p>

<p><a href="#conclusion">Skip to the conclusion section below if you want.</a></p>

<h1 id="why-read-more">Why read more?</h1>
<p>I’ve always loved going to bookstores to flip through coffee table books, browse through fiction book covers, then taking home some “bargain buys” I just had to have. The problem always was I lacked motivation and lost interest in the books after the first day or two of reading.</p>

<p>Probably like most of you, I was always told, from multiple sources, how good reading was. I was told that smart and successful people tend to read a lot. However even if I was eventually able to conjure the motivation to start and finish a book, it would normally drain me of my will to pick up another book once I finished. So after begrudgingly finishing one book I would take multiple months to refill my will power reservoir to pick up another book.</p>

<h1 id="how-i-managed-to-read-more">How I managed to read more</h1>
<h2 id="setting-a-specific-goal">Setting a specific goal</h2>
<p>In the past I tried challenging myself to read more but always seemed to fail. I think one of the reasons was not being specific or reasonable enough in setting my goal. So setting a goal to just one book a month was perfect for me. It was specific enough that at towards the end of a month I could easily say “I am meeting my goal” or “I am failing”. This gave me the extra little motivation to, if I hadn’t made progress on a book, make it a priority and sit down to read a book instead of doing other time wasting activities.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-my-progress">Tracking my progress</h2>
<p>In 2019 I also started keeping a bullet journal (<a href="https://youtu.be/fm15cmYU0IM">this is the video that got me started</a>). In this journal I wrote a special note on the day I finished a book. Doing this seemingly small act gave me a nice little dopamine hit. As the number of books I read started to accumulate the easier it became to pick up the next book.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-new-genres">Exploring new genres</h2>
<p>Normally I only read biographies and tech books (coding principles and books about tech companies). But during this challenge I didn’t really stick to any specific genre I just found any book that looked good or people were recommending and started essentially building a mini library at home. Then I could easily just pick one up and start reading. I purposefully didn’t keep an ordered backlog of books because I didn’t want reading to feel like a chore or TODO list I wanted mystery and excitement in the next book I picked to read.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-used-to-read">What I used to read</h2>
<p>I used everything. When in a car or mowing the lawn, I used an audio book. When in bed after the wife and kid were asleep I used my Kindle Paperwhite. On a Saturday or Sunday morning with a cup of coffee holding a physical book was best. While killing time instead of scrolling through social media feeds the eBook on my phone wasn’t too bad, but definitely my least favorite.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s not very economical to buy every form of a book. So usually I would just buy the physical book, my favorite medium. Every now and then I would splurge and also get the eBook or audio book of a physical copy I already owned. Pro Tip: For most classic books, i.e. old books, you can actually get a legal free version of the eBook and audiobook on sites like <a href="https://librivox.org/">librivox</a>. They even have a mobile apps for ease of use.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you too want to read more or have set a new years resolution to read more here is what I found really helped me:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set a very specific and reasonable goal.</li>
  <li>Track your progress.</li>
  <li>Mix up the type and genre of books you read.</li>
  <li>Don’t limit yourself to one medium. i.e. use eBooks, physical books, and/or audio books. They all have their time and place.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>
<p>After seeing the list and picture of books I read this past year I feel so accomplished and motivated to read even more this new year. Almost at the end of January but I’ll be making a new post here shortly of my new year resolutions for 2020.</p>
