=========================
This is my personal website where you can learn about me and learn about my experiences. 
Right now the plan is to cover technical experience and knowledge. Not exactly how to or tutorial style 
but more of my thoughts on new and maybe old technologies. 

## Start a local server on mac
If you just want to see how I created this website run the following command in the directory were this 
website is and it will start a local web server.
(This works out of the box on Mac I don't know if it works on Windows)
```
php -S localhost:8080
```
